  <div class="disclaimer">
    <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
    <p>A non-custodial bitcoin wallet is a software application that allows you to store, send and receive bitcoin
      without entrusting your private keys to a third party. This means that you have full control and responsibility
      over your funds and transactions. However, it also means that you bear the risks and challenges associated with
      managing your own bitcoin. By using a non-custodial bitcoin wallet, you agree to the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You are solely responsible for securing your private keys and backup phrases. If you lose access to your
        wallet or forget your password, you may not be able to recover your funds. No one, including the wallet
        provider, can help you in this case.
      </li>
      <li>You are solely responsible for verifying the validity and accuracy of the transactions you make or receive. If
        you send bitcoin to a wrong address or fall victim to a scam, fraud or phishing attack, you may not be able to
        reverse or recover your funds.
      </li>
      <li>You are solely responsible for complying with the laws and regulations of your jurisdiction regarding the use
        of bitcoin. You acknowledge that bitcoin transactions are irreversible and may have tax, legal or financial
        implications.
      </li>
      <li>You understand that using a non-custodial bitcoin wallet involves certain risks and limitations, such as
        network congestion, transaction fees, technical issues, hacking attempts and human errors. You accept these
        risks and agree not to hold the wallet provider liable for any loss, damage or inconvenience caused by them.
      </li>
      <li>By using a non-custodial bitcoin wallet, you acknowledge that you have read, understood and agreed to this
        disclaimer. You also confirm that you are of legal age and have the capacity to enter into this agreement.

  <div class="privacy-policy">
    <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>Simple Wallet is a self-custodial Bitcoin wallet designed to operate offline, ensuring user privacy and security.
      Your privacy is important to us, and we are committed to protecting it.</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>No Data Collection</strong> – Simple Wallet does not collect, store, or share any personal data. All
        data, including your wallet information and transaction history, is stored locally on your device.
      </li>
      <li><strong>No Third-Party Services</strong> – Simple Wallet operates entirely offline and does not connect to any
        external servers or third-party services. Your Bitcoin addresses and private keys remain under your full
        control.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Permissions</strong> – The app may request access to:
        <ul>
          <li>Camera: To scan QR codes for Bitcoin addresses.</li>
        </ul>
        This access is only used locally within the app and is not shared or stored externally.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Security</strong> – Since Simple Wallet is a self-custodial wallet, the security of your funds depends
        entirely on how you manage your recovery phrase. We strongly recommend backing up your 12-word recovery phrase
        securely, as losing it means losing access to your funds permanently.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Changes to This Policy</strong> – We may update this privacy policy if necessary. Any changes will be
        reflected in this document, and continued use of the app indicates your acceptance of the updated policy.
      </li>
