    <h3>Disclaimer</h3>
    <p>A non-custodial bitcoin wallet is a software application that allows you to store, send and receive bitcoin
      without entrusting your private keys to a third party. This means that you have full control and responsibility
      over your funds and transactions. However, it also means that you bear the risks and challenges associated with
      managing your own bitcoin. By using a non-custodial bitcoin wallet, you agree to the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You are solely responsible for securing your private keys and backup phrases. If you lose access to your
        wallet or forget your password, you may not be able to recover your funds. No one, including the wallet
        provider, can help you in this case.
      </li>
      <li>You are solely responsible for verifying the validity and accuracy of the transactions you make or receive. If
        you send bitcoin to a wrong address or fall victim to a scam, fraud or phishing attack, you may not be able to
        reverse or recover your funds.
      </li>
      <li>You are solely responsible for complying with the laws and regulations of your jurisdiction regarding the use
        of bitcoin. You acknowledge that bitcoin transactions are irreversible and may have tax, legal or financial
        implications.
      </li>
      <li>You understand that using a non-custodial bitcoin wallet involves certain risks and limitations, such as
        network congestion, transaction fees, technical issues, hacking attempts and human errors. You accept these
        risks and agree not to hold the wallet provider liable for any loss, damage or inconvenience caused by them.
      </li>
      <li>By using a non-custodial bitcoin wallet, you acknowledge that you have read, understood and agreed to this
        disclaimer. You also confirm that you are of legal age and have the capacity to enter into this agreement.
      </li>
