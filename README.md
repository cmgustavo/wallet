## Disclaimer

A non-custodial bitcoin wallet is a software application that allows you to
store, send and receive bitcoin without entrusting your private keys to a
third party. This means that you have full control and responsibility over
your funds and transactions. However, it also means that you bear the risks
and challenges associated with managing your own bitcoin. By using a
non-custodial bitcoin wallet, you agree to the following:

- You are solely responsible for securing your private keys and backup
phrases. If you lose access to your wallet or forget your password, you
may not be able to recover your funds. No one, including the wallet
provider, can help you in this case.

- You are solely responsible for verifying the validity and accuracy of the
transactions you make or receive. If you send bitcoin to a wrong address
or fall victim to a scam, fraud or phishing attack, you may not be able to
reverse or recover your funds.

- You are solely responsible for complying with the laws and regulations of
your jurisdiction regarding the use of bitcoin. You acknowledge that
bitcoin transactions are irreversible and may have tax, legal or financial
implications.

risks and limitations, such as network congestion, transaction fees,
technical issues, hacking attempts and human errors. You accept these
risks and agree not to hold the wallet provider liable for any loss,
damage or inconvenience caused by them.

understood and agreed to this disclaimer. You also confirm that you are of
