store, send and receive bitcoin without entrusting your private keys to a
third party. This means that you have full control and responsibility over
your funds and transactions. However, it also means that you bear the risks
and challenges associated with managing your own bitcoin. By using a

may not be able to recover your funds. No one, including the wallet
provider, can help you in this case.
